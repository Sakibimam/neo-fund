# NeoFund - Decentralized Startup Funding Platform

## Problem Statement

Access to capital is a major barrier for startups, especially those in emerging markets or underserved sectors. Traditional funding mechanisms like venture capital, loans, and grants often come with high barriers to entry, including stringent application processes, limited access, high-interest rates, and a lack of transparency. Even when funding is secured, there's no guarantee that the capital will be used as promised, leading to mistrust between investors and startups. This creates a gap in opportunities for innovative startups to scale and thrive.

## Solution Statement

Our app offers a decentralized platform built on **NeoChain**, a blockchain specifically focused on funding startups. Startups can create campaigns to seek financial backing, and investors can contribute through loans, grants, or non-repayable contributions. By leveraging the transparency and immutability of blockchain technology, all transactions are traceable, and investors can be confident that their funds are being utilized as intended. This platform democratizes access to capital for startups, providing a secure and trust-based environment where entrepreneurs can focus on growth without the uncertainty of traditional funding methods.
